        Many GeneXus-related operations make use of the MSBuild engine (eg:
        checkout, update, build).
        Select here the MSBuild installation you want to use with this GeneXus
        installation.
    </p>

        Select "(Default)" to use whatever MSBuild.exe can be found in the system
        PATH (if any).

        The options that appear here are those you may configure in Jenkins
